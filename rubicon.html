      The Jeep Wrangler is a series of compact and mid-size four-wheel drive
      off-road SUVs manufactured by Jeep since 1986, and currently in its fourth
      generation. The Wrangler JL, the most recent generation, was unveiled in
      late 2017 and is produced at Jeep's Toledo Complex. The Wrangler is a
      direct progression from the World War II Jeep, through the CJ (Civilian
      Jeeps) produced by Willys, Kaiser-Jeep and American Motors Corporation
      (AMC) from the mid-1940s through 1980s. Although neither AMC nor Chrysler
      (after its purchase of AMC in 1987) have claimed that the Wrangler was a
      direct descendant of the original military model — both the CJ Jeeps and
      the conceptually consistent Wrangler, with their solid axles and open top,
      have been called the Jeep model as central to Jeep's brand identity as the
      rear-engined 911 is to Porsche.[1] Similar to the Willys MB and the CJ
      Jeeps before it, all Wrangler models continue to use a separate body and
      frame, rigid live axles both front and rear, a tapering nose design with
      flared fenders, a fold-flat windshield, and can be driven without doors.
      Also, with few exceptions, they have part-time four-wheel drive systems,
      with the choice of high and low gearing, and standard are open bodies with
      removable hard- or soft-tops. However, the Wrangler series was
      specifically redesigned to be safer and more comfortable on-road, to
      attract more daily drivers,[2] by upgrading its suspension, drivetrain,
      and interior, compared to the CJ line. The suspension on all Wranglers
      included trackbars and anti-roll bars, and, from the 1997 TJ onwards,
      front and rear coil springs instead of the previous leaf-springs.[3] From
      2004 on, the Wrangler has been complemented with long-wheelbase versions,
      called Wrangler Unlimited. 2004-2006 models were longer versions with 2
      doors. In 2004 only automatic transmission-equipped “Unlimited” versions
      were sold. In 2005 both an automatic and manual 6-speed (NSG-370) were
      offered. Since 2007, the long-wheelbase Wranglers were four-door models,
      offering over 20 in (508 mm) more room. By mid 2017 the four-door models
      represented three-quarters of all new Wranglers on the market.[4]
